India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX) is a transformative initiative of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India to provide a data exchange platform to Indian cities. IUDX serves as a seamless interface for data providers and data users, including ULBs, to share, request, and access datasets related to cities, urban governance, and urban service delivery. The platform has been developed by the Smart Cities Mission and is implemented by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.

### IUDX 
IUDX is completely open source, based on an underlying framework of open standard APIs, data models, and the security, privacy and accounting mechanisms that will facilitate its easy adoption across the digital ecosystem.
