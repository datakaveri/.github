## Hi, this is IUDX 👋

[![Our](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Our&message=Website&color=blue)](https://dataforpublicgood.org.in/technology/)

Our platform has been built through rigorous research, real-world validation, and a deep commitment to open standards. Drawing inspiration from leading global initiatives while tailoring it to India’s unique needs, the CDPG’s Intelligent Universal Data Exchange (IUDX) Platform delivers a trusted digital infrastructure for seamless and secure data sharing.

By connecting data silos within cities, academic institutions, government bodies, and enterprises, our platform enables the creation of dynamic data ecosystems that catalyse innovation and improve public services.

### IUDX 
IUDX is completely open source, based on an underlying framework of open standard APIs, data models, and the security, privacy and accounting mechanisms that will facilitate its easy adoption across the digital ecosystem.

The IUDX platform employs a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture, separating responsibilities across the Control Plane and Data Plane for maximum security and flexibility. This modular architecture ensures that data providers and consumers interact securely, efficiently, and in accordance with policy and consent.
